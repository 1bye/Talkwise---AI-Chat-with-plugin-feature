## About

Talkwise is an AI Chat application similar to Chat GPT. It offers more features compared to Chat GPT (without new preview code, but I'm working on implementing it into Talkwise). Some of its upgraded features include enhanced markdown, enhanced prompts, a prompts library, a folder system, and a plugin system, which is currently in alpha like Talkwise itself.

## Plugins

Currently, the plugin system is in alpha, and it may have some errors, bugs, or may not have enough features to implement certain functionalities. You can navigate to the [docs](https://docs.nouro.app/) for more information on creating plugins.

**If you are interested in this project, please consider helping to improve the plugin system. Feel free to open new issues if you have ideas or find any bugs or errors.**
